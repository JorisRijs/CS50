Caesar algorithm:

c is computed as:
    ci = (pi + k) % 26

    - c = ciphertext
        - ci = each letter in the cipher text
    - p = plaintext
        - pi = the ith character in the plaintext
    - k = key
    
TODO
- Get key
    command line argument 
    - emsure single command line argument
    - make sure argument contains only digit characters
        - check each character individually
    - convert argument to an integer
- get plaintext
    - get_string
- encipher the plaintext
    - if it's alphabetic, shift plaintext character by key, perserving case
    - if not alphabetic, nothing has to change
    functions:
        - is alpha
        - is upper
        - is lower
- print ciphertext
